# HW11.11.20NodeExpressHandlebars

This application is "semi finished".

It starts with a MySQL Database which stores a bunch of burgers with an indicator if they have been eaten or not.

When the user loads the page, the route will request from the database all the burgers and then print them to the browser with a button to devour the burgers.

The user has the option to add more burgers to the database.

(This function does not work) however, the user should be able to 'devour' a burger which moves the burger to a different section by changing the BOOLEAN value.

This application is deployed on Heroku.
